I’m currently building the foundations of my personal and professional journey.  
Here are some ongoing and upcoming projects I’m working toward:

### 🚧 Personal Brand Website
This website is my first major project — designed to showcase my growth, ideas, skills, and work.

### ✈ Travel & Tourism Insights (Coming Soon)
I plan to share my lessons, internship experiences, and travel knowledge as I grow in the industry.

### 💡 Learning & Tech Experiments
Small explorations involving automation, tools, systems, cybersecurity basics, and computer concepts.

### 📘 Blog & Content Development  
A long-term space where I will write about personal growth, leadership, creativity, and my journey as an aspiring entrepreneur.

More updates will be posted as each part of my journey evolves.
